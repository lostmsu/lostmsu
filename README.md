<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Victor Nova</h1>
<h4 align="center">Enterpreneur | .NET developer | OSS maintainer</h4>

I'm the founder of [Borg.games](https://borg.games/), the first (to my knowledge) peer-to-peer cloud gaming platform, and the developer of [Stack WM](https://losttech.software/stack-whatsnew.html): the best custom window manager for Windows (but of course it is the best: you can define your whole desktop in XAML)!

I also double in compilers and translators when bored.
  
Feel free to reach out to me anywhere about that kind of stuff, or read [AI blog](https://ml.blogs.losttech.software/) for cool .NET samples.
